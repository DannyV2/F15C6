She dresses simply and avoids the ostentation of the court at Kings Landing, preferring to wear the grey of House Stark or the blue and red of her father Hoster Tullys household. Catelyn is proud, strong, kind, and generous. She is seen as honourable and upright by acquaintances, holding duty over desire as a governing principle of behaviour. Catelyn also has a strong grasp of politics and possesses considerable insight into what makes Westeros run. Nevertheless, Catelyn is also a fiercely protective woman and more often than not follows her heart rather than her head, especially when it comes to her family, whom she loves deeply. She follows strongly the words of her house. House Tullys words are Family. Duty. Honor. However, she regards the bastard Jon Snow as an outsider to her family, and has never forgiven Eddard Stark for bringing him into the Stark household. She holds to the Faith of the Seven.'})"

Bran is a sweet and thoughtful boy, wellloved by everyone at Winterfell. He has a fascination with climbing and exploring along the walls and ramparts of the castle. Lady Catelyn once jested that Bran could climb before he could walk, however, his climbing often distresses her. Like his siblings, he is also dutiful and tough minded, as well as possessing a propensity for adventure and excitement. His half-brother Jon fondly thinks to himself that Bran was always stubborn and curious, and in like manner constantly wanted to join in the play of the older boys, believing himself an adult at seven. However, he becomes more serious and contemplative due to his increasingly worsening situation after his fall. Bran is constantly accompanied by his direwolf, whom he names Summer, with whom he shares a strong warg connection.

Jaime has the quintessential Lannister look, with bright green eyes and golden hair. He is considered to be extremely handsome, his tall frame complemented with comely features and a smile that cut like a knife. Jon Snow thinks to himself that Jaime is what a king should look like. He dresses in white, like any member of the Kingsguard when on duty, but he also wears his family colors and distinctive armor of his own at other times gold-plated, with a lions head helm. Jaime comes across as arrogant, amoral, and dishonorable, behavioural traits similar to his sister twin Cersei. Because Jaime has done reprehensible acts he has such a bad reputation, everything he says is usually cast in the worst possible light. An offhand joke is taken as a grave threat by others, just because it is spoken by the Kingslayer. And as for honor, Jaime took his Kingsguard vows, but when they conflict, he chooses a course of action and follows it to its conclusion, no matter the consequence.'})"
